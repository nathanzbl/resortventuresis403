                <p class="">Aloha!

                    We welcome all owners and guests and know that you will treat our condo with the same respect and
                    care you do your home. Enjoy your stay.
                    
                    WHEN YOU ARRIVE:
                    
                    Check in time is 4 p.m Monday. You can arrive earlier, but please don't bother the cleaning service if they are still there.
                    Remember the lock box code. If you keep the key in the box, you will never be locked out! It is also the combo door code now.
                    Call the cleaning service and let them know you are staying the week. To keep costs lower, we only want the cleaning service to come if the condo is used. If you are staying two consecutive weeks, you can choose to have the condo cleaned or not half way through your stay.
                    If you DO NOT let me know you are not using your week and the cleaning crew comes, it is a $200 assessment to you.
                    WHILE YOU ARE HERE:
                    
                    If you need laundry or dishwasher soap, buy it.
                    Please don't use spray sunscreen inside the condo. It is difficult to clean off the carpet and floors.
                    Don't go to the Resident Manager's office expecting services that are normally provided at resort offices. They manage the property for the Association and have no responsibility for assisting you in finding your way around Ekolu, Wailea or Maui.
                    Don't seek lower owner rates at Wailea's golf and tennis facilities. We have many partners and are not eligible to extend lower user fees to our partnership.
                    If locked out, do not bother the Resident Manager, call a locksmith.
                    When sitting on the upholstered furniture in the living room after applying sunscreen or just after returning from the beach, please put a clean, dry towel over the furniture to protect it.
                    Treat the condo as you would your own home. Fix any small items which are broken, clean small messes as needed, treat the fixtures, furniture and appliances with care.
                    Be respectful of neighbors by not playing the television too loudly, etc.
                    BEFORE YOU LEAVE:
                    
                    Check out is 11 a.m. Monday. It is NOT engraved in stone, but the cleaning service needs to clean before the next guests.
                    To save all of us money, put the sheets and towels on to wash and dry for the maid service. Starting the laundry as soon as you rise in the morning allows for several loads.
                    Don’t remake the beds, just leave the clean sheets folded on the beds and you can leave things in the dryer if you have to leave before they are done.
                    Clean and put all dishes and pots and pans away. Straighten up any furniture that you’ve moved. You don’t have to clean the bathrooms or vacuum.
                    Lock up all doors and put the spare key back in lock box if you have removed it and bring our set of keys home with you. You can leave windows half open but lock the sliding doors.
                    BEFORE YOU ARRIVE HOME:
                    
                    Please let Eric Blatter (925-984-3626 (c) eric.blatter@kraftheinz.com) know if there were problems with the condo, or maintenance which needs to be done.
                    Have a wonderful vacation!
